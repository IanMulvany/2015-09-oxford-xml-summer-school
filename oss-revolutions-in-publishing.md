# revolutions in publishing

Scientific publishing has been a going concern since the 1660’s, and yet since then some aspects  of publishing has changed remarkably little, both in terms of the business models (subscription publishing) and core formats of discourse (static documents,   
initially in paper, now in PDF).   
  
(That the entire scholarly record is effectively now online, and discoverable is an amazing achievement, and the importance of this should not be overlooked or it’s significance ignored).   
  
This course will look at some of the current key changes that are happening in the industry from both business and technological perspectives.   
  
We are going to step through some example innovations that are happening. I have clustered these into trends that are having an immediate and important effect, trends that look like they have the potential to be game changes in the next five years, and then finally I’ll spend a small amount of time talking about highly speculative trends.   
  
These trends have implications for publishers, researchers and the general public, and I’ll highlight those as we go through this course.   
  
If there is any unifying theme to all of these trends, it is that they are all driven by opportunities created by the internet, and the new capabilities that it provides around processing and tracking information, and the potential decrease in costs that are associated with manipulating purely digital objects.

## Caveats

Before going into these topics I want to set out my stall and be very clear about my biases: 

### advocate for open access

### no formal background in XML 

### a fan of the open web 

#### 

### some experience of building publishing workflows from scratch 

### some experience in building some tools for researchers

#### connotea

#### nature netowrk

#### mendeley

#### eLife

## dominant trends

For the dominant trends I’ve picked the following three:  
  
- Open Access    
- Research Data     
- AltMetrics 

### Business models / Open Access

From the business point of view we will look at the rise of open access, discuss the different flavours of open access, and discuss the how creative commons licences can support the goals of open access. We will look at how commercial and non-commerical publishers have adopted open access. We will look at growing number of government and funder open access mandates, and   
ask whether this means that open access is a lock in as the only viable publishing model in the future.

#### Subscription

- reader/librarian pays
  Can be argued that this fairly places the burden of the costs of production on the target market, however IMO the bundling that happens in big deals makes this argument less water tight. 

- low risk for the publisher

- very low barriers for the author

	- usually no fees

#### Open access

- Budapest declaration 
  February 2012   
    
  Came out of a meeting funded by the Soros foundation (George Soros was a student of Karl Popper, and later a merchant banker)  
    
  13 original signatories   
    
  outlined the definition of open access   
    
  Interestingly at that time no specific licence was mentioned. 

	- Free to Read

	- Free to Reuse 

	- Free to Modify 

- Licences

	- colors of open access

		- Green
		  authors can deposit their content into a repository, some restrictions may apply around format and rights for re-use. 

		- Diamond
		  Content goes through the normal publising process, but fees are supported though public or charitable funds, and authors experience no need to arrange payment 

		- Hybrid
		  A journal supports a mixture of subscription based articles and gold open access articles in the same journal, this has tended to be a bit of a clusterfuck. 

		- Gold
		  An article processing fee is paid for the article to be published. 

	- Creative common licences
	  Listed from most permissive to least permissive.   
	    
	  note that CC0 is not technically a licence. 

		- CC0

		- CC-BY

		- CC-BY-NC

		- CC-BY-NC-ND

- Funders and Funder mandates

	- Wellcome Trust
	  2013

	- White House Memo
	  [OSTP memo]([https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/02/22/expanding-public-access-results-federally-funded-research](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/02/22/expanding-public-access-results-federally-funded-research)) was released in February 2013   
	    
	  No funds were set aside for achieving compliance of the memo, and that has led to adoption probably being somewhat slow. 

		- CHORUS
		  Launched 2014

		- PubMedCommons
		  Launched in 2000

		- ArXiV
		  Launched in 1991

	- HEFCE
	  2014

	- Bill & Melinda Gates Policy
	  2014

	- NRO
	  2015

	- by 2014 over 500 OA policies, growing at 16% y/y

- publishers

	- BMC

	- PLOS

	- eLife

	- University Presses

	- PeerJ

	- Elsevier

	- SpringerNature

- has OA been a success?

	- yes

		- more content is available free to read

		- most funders have accepted that OA is in line with their mission

		- most new journal launched today are OA journals

	- if so, why?

		- commerical publishers have discovered that it can be profitable 

		- it appeals to our better angels 

		- it strongly aligns with ideas of the public good

		- the idea of creating a well functioning marketplace is also an appealing one 

	- no

		- global costs in the industry have continued to rise, and not been checked

		- commerical publishers have retained an almost monopoly position in the market

		- most authors today remain uninterested in OA

	- if not, why not? 

		- there remain a collective action problem

			- 

		- publishing infrastructure is baroque (including XML workflows)

			- this means direct to web solutions have not disrupted the existing scholarly publishing infrastructure  

		- journals remain a collection of micro-monopolies 

#### meaning

- Multiple Business models

	- Article Processing Charges

		- Service Model
		  possibly more author focussed than the subscription model

	- membership model

	- direct support model

		- diamond open access

	- making the cost of production disappear 

- subscription is a content based model

	- access: the main customer is the institutional librarian

	- sponsorship

	- advertising

	- reprints 

- open access is a service based model

	- the main customer is the author 

		- authors still want
		  author needs can still be served by XML workflows, but the rest of the stack is not serving them well. 

			- fair and balanced peer review 

			- rapid publication times

			- a “good publication”

			- a discoverable publication

				- indexing in google scholar

					- (why can’t I find my article)

				- coverage in scopus

					- 

				- discipline specific archiving 

### Research Data

Research data is currently one of the hot topics in scientific discourse, working out how to handle it, how to support good creation of data, how to give appropriate credit for activities that surround data. We will look at a few aspects of data, and why it’s such an important trend in the STM sector.   
  
TODO: pull in slides from data and literature talk. 

#### Why care about data?

It’s obvious to say this, but the data that research is built on is an integral part of the scientific process.   
  


#### What’s the relationship between the paper, and data?

A fair criticism of current publishing workflows is that publishers force authors to reduce much of their raw data into the form of graphics or images, and then to compress these images into low resolution versions for inclusion in a manuscript. The reader wants to get the underlying data, but has to go through a lot of hoops to get it. 

- It’s one component of a research object!

	- Article

	- Data 

	- Code

- It’s one component of a story from the author

	- Preprints

	- Posters

- It’s an evolution of a narrative

	- versioning and changing research objects

		- github inspired publishing platforms

			- overleaf

			- astro journal thing? 

			- giving a DOI to each revision of an article?

				- giving a DOI to each item of a dataset?

- The relationship between different components can be signalled. 

#### Scales of data

- BIG Data

- small data

- data that is starting to get out of control 

#### Flavours of data

- Well structured 

- semi-structured 

- totally unstructured 

#### Getting credit for data

#### How to handle data?

- We don’t really know

- some data journals coming to market

- now exists a way to cite data, but not widely used yet

- libraries and research infrastructure facilities starting to provide services (e.g. CERN - Zenodo)

- Funders increasingly looking to bring in open data policies

### AltMetrics

#### what are they?

TODO: show “the slide!”

#### what’s their history?

Manifesto was written in 2005 

#### what’s the current state of the art? 

- altmetrics.com

	- Nature

	- Springer

	- Wiley

- lagotto  - the open source tool 

	- PLOS

	- copernicus

	- eLife

- plumb analytics

- publishers creating or running their own platforms

	- frontiers

- repositories adding UIDs

	- figshare

	- datadryad

	- zenodo

#### what’s next for ALMs?

- They provide a variety of different kinds of value to different actors in the space, but there has not yet been a “killer app”

#### but what are they really about? 

- They are really about problems in the assessment and rewards system in academia.

	- see DORA - the declaration on research assessment

#### Where can you go to learn more about them?

#### What have they got to do with XML, markup and structure?

- data citation 

- well identified objects help

- objects that show their interrelationship help

- the fuller a digital life that an object has, the easier it is to automate the gathering of information about that object, that can then facilitate the creation of stories around that object.

### Reproducibility

#### What’s the issue with reproducibility

  
[2011 - 80% of studies could not be replicated]([http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v10/n5/full/nrd3439.html)](http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v10/n5/full/nrd3439.html)  
  
  
[AMGEN result - 88% could not be replicated]([http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/28/us-science-cancer-idUSBRE82R12P20120328)](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/28/us-science-cancer-idUSBRE82R12P20120328)  
  
  
[nature editorial on the topic]

#### Efforts to address this problem

- computable papers

- retraction watch

- centre for open science
  [Reproducibility project]([https://osf.io/ezcuj/wiki/home/)](https://osf.io/ezcuj/wiki/home/)  
  

#### what are we doing at eLife

- RPCB

	- our process

		- paper selection

		- registered reports

		- peer reviewed replication studies

- criticisms

	- expense

	- negative connotations of failing to get your paper replicated

	- waste of effort, more effort should be put into novel research

- why can’t papers get replicated?

	- lack of sharing of data

	- poorly described protocols

	- the experiment is just really hard

### Technology

#### The browser 

- Safari

- Atom

- Manuscripts.app

#### Classic Steps In Publishing

All of these steps can now be implemented in the browser, with rich applications. 

- Authoring

- Submission

- Peer review 

- Document conversion

- Content enhancement 

- Annotation

- Corrections cycle

- Pdf / print / pagination 

- Downstream applications

- Search

#### Markup Markdown and around

this is about the different options we have nowadays for transforming content from one kind into another, these include form mind maps to markdown to xml to JSON, and probably back around again.
