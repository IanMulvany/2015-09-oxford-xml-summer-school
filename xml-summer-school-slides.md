# revolutions in publishing

Scientific publishing has been a going concern since the 1660’s, and yet since then
the practice of publishing has changed remarkably little, both in terms of the
business models (subscription publishing) and core formats of discourse (static documents,
initially in paper, now in PDF).

This course will look at some of the key changes that are happening in the industry
from both business and technological perspectives. We will then look at a worked example
by stepping through the workflows in operation inside of a new open access publisher - eLife.

## Caveats

I will spend a

### advocate for open access

### no formal background in XML

### a fan of the open web

####

### some experience of building publishing workflows from scratch

### some experience in building some tools for researchers

---

#### connotea

#### nature netowrk

#### mendeley

#### eLife

## Business models

From the business point of view we will look at the rise of open access, discuss the different
flavours of open access, and discuss the how creative commons licences can support the goals of
open access. We will look at how commercial and non commerical publishers have adopted open
access. We will look at growing number of government and funder open access mandates, and
ask whether this means that open access is a lock in as the only viable publishing model in the future.

### Subscription

#### low risk for the publisher

#### very low barriers for the author

- usually no fees

#### reader pays

can be good for a number of reasons

### Open access

#### Budapest declaration

February 2012

Came out of a meeting funded by the Soros foundation (George Soros was a student of Karl Popper, and later merchant banker)

13 original signatories

outlined the definition of open access

- Free to Read

- Free to Reuse

- Free to Modify

#### Funders and Funder mandates

- White House Memo

- NRO

- Wellcome Trust

- HEFCE

---

#### Licences

- colors of open access

	- Green
	  authors can deposit their content into a repository, some restrictions may apply around format and rights for re-use.

	- Diamond
	  Content goes through the normal publising process, but fees are supported though public or charitable funds, and authors experience no need to arrange payment

	- Hybrid
	  A journal supports a mixture of subscription based articles and gold open access articles in the same journal, this has tended to be a bit of a clusterfuck.

	- Gold
	  An article processing fee is paid for the article to be published.

- Creative common licences

	- CC-BY

	- CC-BY-NC

---

#### Multiple Business models

- Article Processing Charges

	- Service Model
	  possibly more author focussed than the subscription model

- membership model

- direct support model

	- diamond open access

- making the cost of production disappear

---

#### publishers

- BMC

- PLOS

- eLife

- University Presses

- PeerJ

#### Text and data mining rights

#### has OA been a success?

- yes

	- more content is available free to read

	- most funders have accepted that OA is in line with their mission

	- most new journal launched today are OA journals

- no

	- global costs in the industry have continued to rise, and not been checked

	- commerical publishers have retained an almost monopoly position in the market

	- most authors today remain uninterested in OA

- if so, why?

	- commerical publishers have discovered that it can be profitable

	- it appeals to our better angels

	- it strongly aligns with ideas of the public good

	- the idea of creating a well functioning marketplace is also an appealing one

- if not, why not?

	- there remain a collective action problem

		-

	- publishing infrastructure is baroque (including XML workflows)

		- this means direct to web solutions have not disrupted the existing scholarly publishing infrastructure

	- journals remain a collection of micro-monopolies

### meaning

#### subscription is a content based model

- the main customer is the institutional librarian

#### open access is a service based model

- the main customer is the author

	- authors still want
	  author needs can still be served by XML workflows, but the rest of the stack is not serving them well.

		- fair and balanced peer review

		- rapid publication times

		- a “good publication”

		- a discoverable publication

			- indexing in google scholar

				- (why can’t I find my article)

			- coverage in scopus

				-

			- discipline specific archiving

## Technology

### The browser

### Classic STM applications

#### Content enhancement

#### Pdf / print / pagination

#### Downstream applications

#### Peer review

#### Annotation

#### Search

#### Document conversion

### Research objects

#### Article

#### Data

#### Code

#### Preprint a

#### Posters

#### formal corrections

#### versioning and changing research objects

- github inspiried publishing platforms

	- overleaf

	- astro journal thing?

	- giving a DOI to each revision of an article?

## Concrete example - eLife

### Submission

#### authors fill in form fields

#### metadata exported

- CSV

- XML

- FTP

- AWS

### Content Procsessing

### Intermediate processing

####

## Markup Markdown and around

this is about the different options we have nowadays for transforming content from one kind into another, these include form mind maps to markdown to xml to JSON, and probably back around again.
